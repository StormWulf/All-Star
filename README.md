# All-Star
Decks for All-Star tournaments
- For those playing YGOPro Percy, you can easily add one of the decks by saving it in your `deck` folder, which is likely located in `C:\Program Files (x86)\YGOPro\deck`
- The pre-errata cards such as Crush Card Virus and Dark Strike Fighter use the card ID of the pre-errata version. This isn't compatible with DevPro.
- To play these decks, you'll have to play under the Unlimited banlist and either enable Anime cards or disable check deck
